Summary		:	This script will be called by an Azure Data Factory pipeline, and the 
				results used to execute all tasks with the same sequence number in 
				parallel.

				Note that only "active" (ExecuteTask = 1) processes and tasks with be 
                returned in the results.

				Parameters: 
				@Environment		    -	Beta/Production/etc.
				@ProcessName		    -	Name of the process to execute, if you want to 
										    execute an entire process. Use 'All' (default) 
										    to execute all processes, or to process a 
                                            single task. 
				@TaskName			    -	Name of the task to execute, if a single 
										    task should be executed. Use 'All' (or omit) 
										    if an entire process should be executed. 
				@ExecutionSequence	    -	Sequence number of the tasks to execute. Use 
										    -9 (or omit) to return all tasks regardless 
										    of the sequence number.
